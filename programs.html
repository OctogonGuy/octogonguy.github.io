    <h1>Programs</h1>
    <p>Some programs I've made. Click to download.</p>

    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>Programs I've made in Java. You should hopefully be able to open any of these .jar files by just double clicking them. However, if you are using a Windows computer, it may not work for some reason. If that is the case, you may need to open it through the command prompt. If you do not know how to do this, perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open "Command Prompt"</li>
      <li>Type "cd [directory to the .jar file]" and press Enter</li>
      <li>Type "java -jar [filename]" and press Enter</li>
    </ol>
