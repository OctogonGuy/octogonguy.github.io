    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Dobutsu Shogi is a game based on shogi, a Japanase board game similar to chess. Dobutsu Shogi ("Animal Shogi") is a version of shogi made primarily for children with simplified rules in 2008 by women's professional shogi player Madoka Kitao. It is played on a 3x4 board and with pieces showing animal designs instead of Chinese characters.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>The players take turns moving one of their pieces. Each piece (chick, elephant, giraffe, or lion) has a different set of directions in which it can move. If a player's piece lands on one an opponent's piece, it is removed from the board and placed into the player's hand. On a subsequent turn, the player may use up that turn to place this piece on any empty space.</p>
    <p>If a chick advances to the furthest row, it becomes a chicken and gains additional movement directions. This does not count, however, if the chick is placed there directly from the player's hand. If a chicken is captured, it reverts back to a chick.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to win:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By "catching," or capturing the opponent's lion</li>
      <li>By "trying," or moving one's own lion to the final rank, so long as it is not in check</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, a game ends in a draw if the players make the same moves for three consecutive turns.</p>
